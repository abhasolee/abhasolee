- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @abhasolee, a freshman at Beloit College intending to major in Computer Science and Quantitative Economics.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in GUI development, front-end web development, and graphic design.
- ðŸŒ± While I'm not coding, you will find me raising voice against contemporary social evils through my blogs or simply re-watching The Office or How I Met Your Mother.
